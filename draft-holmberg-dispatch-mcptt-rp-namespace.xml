          This document creates an additional Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
          Resource-Priority namespace to meet the requirements of the 3GPP defined Mission
          Critical Push To Talk, and places this namespace in the IANA registry.

		<section title="Introduction">
	     <t>
           The third generation partnership project (3GPP) has defined a Mission Critical
           Push To Talk (MCPTT) over LTE service <xref target="TS.3GPP.22.179" />. The MCPTT
           service supports an enhanced PTT service, suitable for mission critical scenarios,
           based upon 3GPP Evolved Packet System (EPS) services. The requirements for the
           MCPTT service defined within 3GPP can also form the basis for a non-mission
           critical Push To Talk (PTT) service.
       </t>
	     <t>
	         The MCPTT service is intended to support communication between several users (a group
           call), where each user has the ability to gain access to the permission to talk in an
           arbitrated manner. However, the MCPTT service also supports private calls between pairs
           of users.
	    </t>
	    <t>
           MCPTT is primarily targeting to provide a professional Push To Talk service to
           e.g., public safety, transport companies, utilities or industrial and nuclear plants.
           In addition to this a commercial PTT service for non-professional use (e.g., groups of
           people on holiday) may be delivered through an MCPTT system. Based on their operational
           model, the performance and MCPTT features in use vary per user organization, where
           functionality which is more mission critical specific (e.g., Imminent Peril Call) might
					 not be available to commercial customers.
      </t>
	    <t>
           The MCPTT service provides its users with different priorities for the access to
           network resources in order to provide means to prioritize between calls when resources
           are scarce. These priorities take into account among other things the priority and role
           of the caller, the priority and type of the group, and the situation in which the call
           is made. According to <xref target="TS.3GPP.22.179" /> at least 8 and up to 30 priority
           levels are required.
	    </t>
      <t>
           High priority calls when there is danger of life for either the public safety worker
           or any other human need to be set up immediately and thus require preemption. Other
           calls may be less sensitive in call set-up time but have a high priority once
           established. For these calls a queueing mechanism is more appropriate.
      </t>
	    <t>
	         This document creates additional Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	         Resource-Priority namespaces to meet the requirements of the 3GPP
	         defined Mission Critical Push To Talk, and places these namespaces
	         in the IANA registry.
