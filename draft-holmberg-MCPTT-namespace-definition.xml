	   This document creates an additional Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
           Resource-Priority namespace to meet the requirements of the 3GPP defined Mission
           Critical Push To Talk, and places this namespace in the IANA registry.

		<section title="Introduction">
	<t>
           The third generation partnership project (3GPP) has defined a Mission Critical
           Push To Talk (MCPTT) over LTE service <xref target="TS.3GPP.22.179" />. The MCPTT
           service supports an enhanced PTT service, suitable for mission critical scenarios,
           based upon 3GPP Evolved Packet System (EPS) services. The requirements for the 
           MCPTT service defined within 3GPP can also form the basis for a non-mission 
           critical Push To Talk (PTT) service.
        </t>
	<t>
	The MCPTT service is intended to support communication between several users (a group
        call), where each user has the ability to gain access to the permission to talk in an
        arbitrated manner. However, the MCPTT service also supports private calls between pairs
        of users.
	</t>
	<t>
         MCPTT is primarily targeting to provide a professional Push To Talk service to
         e.g., public safety, transport companies, utilities or industrial and nuclear plants.
         In addition to this a commercial PTT service for non-professional use (e.g., groups of
         people on holiday) may be delivered through an MCPTT system. Based on their operational
         model, the performance and MCPTT features in use vary per user organization, where
         functionality which is more mission critical specific (e.g., Ambient Listening and
         Imminent Peril Call) might not be available to commercial customers.
        </t>
	<t>
         The MCPTT service provides its users with different priorities for the access to
         network resources in order to provide means to prioritize between calls when resources
         are scarce. These priorities take into account among other things the priority and role
         of the caller, the priority and type of the group, and the situation in which the call
         is made. According to <xref target="TS.3GPP.22.179" /> at least 8 and up to 30 priority 
         levels are required.
	</t>
	<t>
	This document creates an additional Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Resource-Priority namespace to meet the requirements of the 3GPP
	defined Mission Critical Push To Talk, and places this namespace
	in the IANA registry.
